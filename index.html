<!-- ABOUT THE SHOP -->

    <div>
        <h3>Welcome to Buns and Ovens!</h3>
        <p>We're an independent coffee shop located in East Chatwell, and we take great pride in serving up smiles! Founded 70 years ago by the late Hattie and Jemimah Smith, we are the oldest and most beloved cafe this village has ever seen! Drop in today for a cake, a cuppa, and a connection to your local community!</p>
        <p>This is a Hell Hound and Dire Wolf friendly cafe, but we would appreciate it if you kept your beast on a leash! Some hounds bite first and ask questions later...</p>
        <p>Want to know a little bit about our history? Hattie and Jemimah lived right here in this very shop! Before it was a cafe, it was a home. Jemimah converted this little cottage into a bakery and blacksmith, hence the name, and the couple spent many happy years here working on their respective crafts, side-by-side. Now that they've passed on, we're here to keep this wonderful community staple alive!</p>
